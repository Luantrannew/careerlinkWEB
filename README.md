# Job Recommendation Web App

This is a web application built in Streamlit to demonstrate job recommendation functionality using two main approaches:

**1. Recommendations by CV** - Upload your CV and profile information to receive personalized job matches based on your background and experience.

**2. Recommendations by Keyword** - Enter a job title, skill keywords or other search terms to get recommendations based on those criteria.

The app provides an interactive interface to enter your profile details or search keywords, and displays the results visually with job details and match scores.
